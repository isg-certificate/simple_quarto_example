## Introduction

We can cite papers by attributing things to publications directly like @felsenstein1985phylogenies or making declarative statements supported by a publication [@felsenstein1981evolutionary], or more than one publication [@felsenstein1981evolutionary; @felsenstein1985confidence]. These citations are in **bibtex** format in an accompanying file, `citations.bibtex`. The formatted citations were copied and pasted from the `cite` button in google scholar for each reference. 

It's easy to include images. 

![A painting of a mummichog, *Fundulus heteroclitus*](mummichog.jpg){fig-alt="A painting of a mummichog." #fig-mummichog}

We can reference @fig-mummichog. 

## Methods

If you need to explain some code without running it, you can show it like this, denoting the language for syntax highlighting. This is bash code. 

```bash
head myfile.txt | cut -f 3 | sort | uniq -c
```

## Results

### Results subsection 1

I'm going to make a plot of some simulated data.

```{r}
#| label: fig-rando-plot
#| fig-cap: "Totally bogus data."
x <- rnorm(500, mean=5, sd=2)
y <- x + rnorm(500)
plot(x, y)
```

## Results subsection 2

Let's print this table.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-rando
#| tbl-cap: Random correlated data
df <- data.frame(x=x,y=y)
df 
```

## Results subsection 3

We can also hide the code and just print the results. 

```{r}
#| label: fig-rando-x-hist
#| fig-cap: "Histogram of random x."
#| echo: false
hist(x)
```


## Discussion

You can see from @fig-rando-plot the data are correlated. You can see from @tbl-rando that rendering the whole table is superfluous. You should not be able to see the histogram code for @fig-rando-x-hist in the rendered document.
